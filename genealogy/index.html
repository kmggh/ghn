  <p><em>by G. Monroe Guyton, Geames W. Guyton, and Ken Guyton</em></p>

<p><em>July 1984</em></p>

<p>This is a preliminary report on our research toward establishing the
genealogy of the John Marion Guyton family. We are quite sure that the
information for Generations 1 through 4 and Generations 5 through 8 is
correct and, although we strongly suspect that John Guyton (Generation
5) is the son of Nathaniel (Generation 4), the linking together of
these lines remains to be proven. We hope to add to this information
in a future report.</p>

<h2>Guytons In France</h2>

<blockquote><p>(Giton, Guiton, Guton, Guyton)</p>

<p>Of French Huguenot lineage, the Guytons were among the French
Protestants who left France seeking religious and political freedom,
first in England, later in America.
In &ldquo;Maithol&rsquo;s Directory of the French Nobility&rdquo; we find that &ldquo;the
Guyton family originated in Normandie, with one branch establishing
its residence in Brittany. The family bore the title of count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Concise History of France&rdquo; &mdash;Guizot-Gustave Masson, records the
fact that John Guiton was Burgess of La Rochelle at the time of the
seige by Louis XIII, A.D. 1625. On page 353: &ldquo;The siege of La Rochelle
has become famous in history; it lasted thirteen years and the brave
Huguenots had to surrender in spite of the heroism of Guiton, the
mayor of the town, assisted by the energy of the old Duchess of
Robou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>French history also records the fact that one John W. Guiton was one
of the Generals who fought in the Battle of Waterloo[1].</p></blockquote>

<h2>Early Guytons In America</h2>

<blockquote><p>As early as 1669 we find members of the Guyton family living in South
Carolina, as in this year the records of the Huguenot Society in
Charleston show that Judith Guiton (the widow Royer), was married to
Pierre Manigault[1].</p></blockquote>

<h3>GENERATION 1.</h3>

<p>Samuel Guyton ( ? –1696) and Elizabeth ( ? –1700)[2]
McCall states that Samuel was a Huguenot and places him in Norwich,
England.</p>

<h3>GENERATION 2.</h3>

<p>Samuel Guyton ( ? –1728) and Margaret ( ? –1731)[2]</p>

<p>Baptized in 1668 at St. George&rsquo;s Tombland, Norwich, England.</p>

<h3>GENERATION 3.</h3>

<p>John Guyton ( ? –1783) and Mary [2,3,4,5]</p>

<p>Andrea indicates that Mary may have been Mary Whitticar, the daughter
of John Whitticar but this is unproven[4].</p>

<p>John Guyton was baptized 19 February 1696, St. Martin at Palace,
Norwich, England. He was in Calvert County, Maryland as early as
1732[2] where he was listed in the List of Taxables in Upper Hundred
of the Cliffs[5].</p>

<p>He is in &ldquo;Alyst of the Melitia under the Command Capt. Sutton Isaack,&rdquo;
Upper Hundred of the Cliffs, Calvert County, Maryland, 1748[5].</p>

<p>John and Benjamin Guyton (probably his brother) both moved to
Baltimore County, Maryland, probably during the 1750&rsquo;s, and lived near
each other[5].</p>

<p>John obtained a Maryland Land Grant in 1740 and served in the Colonial
Wars of Maryland[4].</p>

<p>Their children[3,4,5]:</p>

<p>Samuel Guyton (6 Nov 1727– ? ) m. Ann Chance</p>

<p>Joseph Guyton (17 Sep 1732– ? ) m. Hannah Whitaker</p>

<p>* Nathaniel Guyton (29 March 1735– ? )</p>

<p>Sarah Guyton (3 Jan 1737– ? )</p>

<p>Abraham Guyton (8 May 1740– ? )</p>

<p>Isaac Guyton (19 Aug 1742– ? )</p>

<p>Jacob Guyton (11 Nov 1744– ? )</p>

<p>Mary Guyton (4 May 1747– ? ) m. an Underhill</p>

<p>John Guyton (1 Sep 1750– ? ) m. Frances</p>

<p>Joshua Guyton (18 Aug 1757– ? ) m. Sarah Mitchell</p>

<p>(Note that Samuel is not listed in Lisenbe&rsquo;s copy of the will)[3]</p>

<h3>GENERATION 4.</h3>

<p>Nathaniel Guyton (1735– ? ) and Sarah</p>

<p>Nathaniel&rsquo;s will was signed 2 January 1806 and probated 1 October 1810
and is in file 6-18, Union County, SC[4].</p>

<p>Their children[4]:</p>

<p>Isaac Guyton</p>

<p>Jacob Guyton</p>

<p>* John Guyton</p>

<p>Nathaniel Guyton</p>

<p>Hannah Guyton</p>

<p>Holly Tate</p>

<p>Anne Crittenden</p>

<h3>GENERATION 5.</h3>

<p>John Guyton ( ? –1854)[6]</p>

<p>It is not proven that this John is the same John as the son of
Nathaniel, mentioned above.</p>

<p>John Guyton&rsquo;s will was signed 1 July 1854[6].</p>

<p>Philip J. Guyton and Robert H. Guyton are executors of the will of
John Guyton. Also one of us (G. Monroe Guyton) remembers accounts of
John Marion Guyton (see below) telling about the father of Robert H.,
&ldquo;Johnny&rdquo;, and his slaves &ldquo;Hen and Sam.&rdquo; The will mentions three
slaves, Hazar, Sam, and Perry.</p>

<p>It is also interesting that Philip J. and Robert H. have exactly the
same birth date.</p>

<p>Thus, from this evidence, it is believed that Philip J. and Robert
H. are twin brothers and the sons of John.</p>

<p>John does not mention all of his children (or wife) by name in his
will so there are possibly more children.</p>

<p>Their children:</p>

<p>Jerney Guyton[6]</p>

<p>William Guyton[6]</p>

<p>Philip J. Guyton (see above) (23 Sep 1811 – 6 Apr 1875)[7]</p>

<p>* Robert H. Guyton (see above)</p>

<h3>GENERATION 6.</h3>

<p>Robert Habersham Guyton (23 Sep 1811 – 21 Feb 1871)[8] and Catherine
Sanders (13 Apr 1807 – 27 Jul 1865)</p>

<p>We find the name Habersham in a record of Robert&rsquo;s service from 28 Jul
1845 to 3 Apr 1904 as a private in Company 2, 54th Regiment of the
Georgia Infantry. This record in the Georgia State Archives.</p>

<p>Information on the children comes from two sources: Information copied
from an old Guyton family Bible and from Lisenbe[3]. Lisenbe disagrees
in two instances: she lists the birth date of Robert Lafayette as 7
Jun instead of 7 Jan and she indicates the date of marriage to Rachel
as 1883 or 1884.</p>

<p>Their children:</p>

<p>* Marion J. Guyton (18 Jul 1835 – 2 Jan 1898) m. Emily E. Pittman</p>

<p>Hyram Coleman (Cobe) Guyton (29 Sep 1837 – ? )</p>

<p>Jacob (Jake) S. Guyton (23 Jan 1839 – ? ) m. Georgia Ann Flemming on
27 Dec 1866</p>

<p>Ann (8 May 1840 – 27 Apr 1843)</p>

<p>Martha Charlotte Frances (Fannie) Guyton (2 Dec 1841 – ? ) m. Henry
Clay Cook on 27 Sep 1866</p>

<p>T. Emily (Emma) Guyton (27 Apr 1843 – ? ) m. James Knox on 23 June
1907</p>

<p>Mary C. Guyton (26 Aug 1846 – 31 Jan 1855)</p>

<p>Robert Lafayette Guyton (7 Jan 1850 – 22 Feb 1945) m. Rachel
F. Hancock 12 Oct 1874 and second Mollie Mae Milburn (17 May 1867 – 13
Aug 1921)</p>

<h3>GENERATION 7.</h3>

<p>Marion Jackson Guyton (11 Oct 1835 – 2 Jan 1898) and Emily Ellen
Pitman[8]</p>

<p>Lisenbe[3] is the only source of the middle name Jackson, in all other
sources it is Marion J. She also spells Emily&rsquo;s maiden name as
Pittman.</p>

<p>Their children[3]:</p>

<p>Charles Silas m. Anna Eugenia Ward</p>

<p>Gus</p>

<p>James Verderie (Verd) ( ? – Jun 1927) m Lou Smith (1854 – )</p>

<p>Ellie</p>

<p>Lois</p>

<p>Cordelia</p>

<p>Mary</p>

<p>Ophelia</p>

<p>Bobby</p>

<p>Charlie</p>

<p>* John Marion Guyton (26 Nov 1866 &ndash; 24 Nov 1937) m. Missie Delanie
  Simpson (27 Nov 1867 – 10 Mar 1963)</p>

<h3>GENERATION 8.</h3>

<p>John Marion Guyton (26 Nov 1866 – 24 Nov 1937) and Missie Delanie
Simpson (27 Nov 1867 – 10 Mar 1963)</p>

<p>They were married on 29 Dec 1889.</p>

<p>This information on John Marion Guyton and his family is from the
Bible of his wife.[9]</p>

<p>Their children:</p>
